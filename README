SimpleGui is just that, as simple OpenGL GUI class.

It has a rudimentary scene graph, the nodes of which are C++ classes inherited
from "GLObject".  These objects must have a "draw()" funciton.

A GLObject, o, is registred with a GLWindow, g, via g.AddChild( &o ).

See Test/Test.cpp to see how easy it is to create a simple opengl scene with a
mesh and a "grid" GLObject.
