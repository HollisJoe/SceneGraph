SimpleGui is just that, as simple OpenGL GUI class.

It has a rudimentary scene graph, the nodes of which are C++ classes inherited
from "GLObject".  These objects must have a "draw()" funciton.

A GLObject, o, is registred with a GLSceneGraph, g, via g.AddChild( &o ).

The object creator is responsible for the objects lifetime.
