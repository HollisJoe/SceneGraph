SimpleGui is just that, as simple OpenGL GUI class.

It has a rudimentary scene graph, the nodes of which are C++ classes inherited
from "GLObject".  These objects must have a "draw()" funciton.

A GLObject, o, is registred with a GLWindow, g, via g.AddChild( &o ).

See Test/Test.cpp to see how easy it is to create a simple opengl scene with a
mesh and a "grid" GLObject.

The code in the SimpleGui directory is stand-alone and exported so other cmake
projects can just call find_package( SimpleGui ) to set SimpleGui_INCLUDE_DIRS
and SimpleGui_LIBRARIES (which includes all of SimpleGui's dependencies as 
well).

NOTE: YOU MUST HAVE THE SHADERS COPIED INTO THE DIRECTORY THAT THE DEMOS ARE BUILT IN FOR THEM TO RUN! Sorry for the caps.
